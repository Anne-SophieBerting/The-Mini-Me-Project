        <p>This project started out as an assignment for one of my classes, Spaces and Systems. The goal of the assignment was to connect our body to the space around us. I quickly started thinking about travel. Since moving to Arnhem I've been travelling a lot between Arnhem, Breda and Den Haag. These three cities have been playing a main role in my life for the past year. To connect myself with the space around me I wanted to leave something behind everywhere I went. I decided to make various 3D scans of my own body in different positions. These basic positions could fit into most places I visit. For a few weeks I carried these versions of myself in my pocket, leaving them in the place where I felt they belonged. Sometimes these places had emotional connections to me, sometimes purely humorous. Whatever fit my mood at that place, at that time. I then took photographs to record the locations and curate a collection. </p>
